just another repository

Hi there!

I'm bored in a self isolation and I have caught a glimpse of productivity after the excessive amount of carbs I've eaten today :P

An update with the results of my first legit tutorial. I am trying to learn the lingo here so I can put it on my resume/confuse my non-coding friends - 

"By completing this tutorial, you’ve learned to create a project and make a pull request on GitHub!

Here’s what you accomplished in this tutorial:

Created an open source repository
Started and managed a new branch
Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub
Opened and merged a Pull Request "

Here's another update win whih I ACTUALLY follow the tutorial -_*

update - well i actually have to re-do the first tutorial in the book for the 3rd time. while I have managed to commit the changes every single time I go through it - I have difficulties to remember the way that was shown in the tutorial so I have to re-do it once again. Well third time the charm :D

Hi there once again! I spent 1 hour understanding this tutorial and here's what I think:
If there is more than one way to do something in order to get a correct/right result/answer - I will have a HARD time remembering which EXACT way I was shouwn to do it.
